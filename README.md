## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Component Structure (`/src/components/`)

- **ui/** - shadcn/ui components following the established structure
  - `mac-os-dock.tsx` - The dock component with magnification
  - `window.tsx` - Draggable, resizable window component  
  - `menu-bar.tsx` - MacOS-style top menu bar
  - `desktop.tsx` - Main desktop orchestrator

- **apps/** - Individual app components
  - Each app is a self-contained React component
  - Humorous but functional implementations

### State Management (`/src/store/`)

- **desktop-store.ts** - Zustand store for window management
  - Window state (position, size, minimized, maximized)
  - Persistent storage with localStorage
  - Focus management and z-index handling

### Configuration (`/src/lib/`)

- **app-registry.ts** - Central registry for all apps
  - Maps app IDs to components, icons, and default sizes
  - Easy to extend with new apps

## üé® Design System

The project follows shadcn/ui structure with a custom MacOS theme:

### Why `/components/ui`?

This folder structure follows shadcn/ui defaults for several reasons:

1. **Predictable Imports** - Consistent `@/components/ui/*` imports
2. **Component Collocation** - UI primitives grouped together  
3. **Community Standard** - Matches expected React/Next.js patterns
4. **Easy Extension** - Simple to add new shadcn components

### Color System

All colors use HSL values defined in CSS custom properties:

- **MacOS Colors** - Authentic red/yellow/green traffic lights
- **Glassmorphism** - Backdrop blur effects for dock and menus  
- **Dark Theme** - Matches MacOS dark mode aesthetics
- **Semantic Tokens** - Consistent color usage across components
